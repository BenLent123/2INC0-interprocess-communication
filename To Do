- Router dealer calls worker via execlp() but does not input argv[] such as execlp(./worker1, req_id, data, NULL) 
- Router dealer process -> recieve from client --> differentiate request --> fork() to make a child --> child executes worker 1 or 2 --> worker does service and sends back result
- Worker 1 and 2 Cannot work with "while (true) {} --> as break condition has to exist













exmple

int main() {
    int counter = 0; // Example variable to check termination
    int max_count = 5; // Termination condition

    while (1) { // Infinite loop
        if (counter < max_count) {
            printf("Doing stuff... Counter = %d\n", counter);
            counter++; // Update termination checker
        } else {
            break; // Exit the loop
        }
    }
    printf("Exited the loop.\n");
    return 0;
}
