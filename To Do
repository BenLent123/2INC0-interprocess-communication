- Router dealer calls worker via execlp() but does not input argv[] such as execlp(./worker1, req_id, data, NULL) 
- Router dealer process -> recieve from client --> differentiate request --> fork() to make a child --> child executes worker 1 or 2 --> worker does service and sends back result
- Worker 1 and 2 Cannot work with "while (true) {} --> as break condition has to exsist
